```

```
How should I structure a new component for displaying member profiles?
```

#### 3️⃣ **Implement with Guidance**

Let Claude Code help you write code that follows our conventions:

```
Create a new EventCard component that displays event information with the same styling as the existing cards on the homepage.
```

```
Add a dark mode toggle to the Header component following the pattern used in the Terminal component.
```

#### 4️⃣ **Review and Test**

Use Claude Code to review your changes:
